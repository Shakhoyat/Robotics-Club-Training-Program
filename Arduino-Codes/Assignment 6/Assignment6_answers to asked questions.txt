(1) analogWrite() vs digitalWrite():

analogWrite() => continuous signal dite pare e.g building fading led 
digitalWrite() => not continuous either 1(high) or 0(low) e.g either led on/off 

(2) analogRead() vs digitalRead():

analogRead() => precise voltage levels (0-1023) e.g sensors like potentiometer
digitalRead() => reads only HIGH/LOW e.g simple buttons/switches.
